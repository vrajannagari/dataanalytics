## WIFI-Indoor-Locationing
## Investigate feasibility of using wifi fingerprinting to determine a person's location in indoor spaces. We have been provided with a large database of wifi fingerprints for a multi-building campus with a location (including building, floor, and location ID) associated with each fingerprint. Classification task in Python is to evaluate multiple machine learning models to see which produces the best result, enabling us to make a recommendation to the client.
